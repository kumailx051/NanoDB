Semester Research Project: "NanoDB Architecture & Query Optimizer"
Project Overview: This project is about building a mini database system from scratch,
called NanoDB. Think of it like creating a simplified version of MySQL, PostgreSQL, or
SQLite. Instead of just writing queries as an end-user, you will be acting as the core
systems engineer building the engine that processes those queries. You will manage raw
memory, design custom data structures, and implement algorithmic optimizations to
ensure your database can handle large datasets efficiently.
Disclaimer: This is a graduate-level systems project. Standard Library Containers (e.g.,
std::vector, std::map, std::stack) are strictly forbidden. You are the architect; build the
plumbing yourself.

- Dataset & Benchmarking Standard (TPC-H)
To ensure your engine is evaluated against industry standards, you are required to use the
TPC-H Benchmark Dataset. TPC-H is a standard decision-support benchmark used
universally to test database performance.
You will not be provided with the data files directly. As part of your research and setup,
your team must:
- Source the Data: Download or generate a subset of the TPC-H dataset. You must
specifically extract and use the following three tables: customer, orders, and
lineitem.
- Scale Factor: You must generate or extract exactly 100,000 records across these
tables (e.g., 20,000 customers, 30,000 orders, 50,000 line items).
The Workload File: You must create a ‘queries.txt’ file containing 50 specific SQL-like
string commands that query your TPC-H data (ranging from simple INSERT statements
to complex multi-condition SELECT queries with joins). Your automated Test Runner
must read and execute this file during the demo.


## 2. Core Directives & Architectural Hints
A. The Memory Layer (The Pager)
- Hint: Your database cannot load a 10GB file into 8GB of RAM. You have a fixed-size
raw contiguous block. Manage it.
- Hint: When the block is full, who leaves? Implement a cache eviction policy. A
Singly Linked List won't cut it for 푂(1) removals; think bidirectional. If you need a
round-robin logging system for transactions, how do you loop without tracking the
tail?
- Constraint: Serialize and deserialize your memory pages directly to disk via raw
## File Operations.
## B. The Schema & Type Engine
- Hint: A row contains an int, a float, and a string. An array expects uniform types.
How  do  you  bypass  this?  Think  abstractly.  Base  classes,  virtual  tables,  and
## Polymorphism.
- Hint: How  does  the  engine  know  if  "Apple"  >  "Banana"  or  10  ==  10  without
hardcoding if-statements for every type? Operator Overloading is your friend here.
- Hint: For metadata (System Catalog: Table names, file paths), 푂(푁) searches are
unacceptable. Map them to memory with 푂(1) collisions resolution. Hashing is
mandatory.
C. The Query Parser (The Compiler)
- Hint: A user submits: WHERE (Age > 20 AND Salary < 5000) OR Department ==
"HR". The machine reads a string.
- Hint: You need to parse this. Read up on Expression evaluation and Infix to Postfix
conversion.  Evaluate  the  resulting  mathematical/logical  tree  using  custom
## Stacks.
- Constraint: High-priority admin queries must bypass background user queries.
Funnel these through a Priority Queue.
D. The Execution Engine (The Optimizer)
- Hint: Sequential Array scans are 푂(푁). Build an index. It must self-correct its
height upon insertions/deletions to maintain 푂(푙표푔 푁) lookups. Balance Binary
Trees are required.

- Hint: Multi-way joins are expensive. If the user queries Table A JOIN Table B JOIN
Table C, what is the cheapest execution path?
- Hint: Map the tables as nodes and join-costs as edges (Graph Representation).
Find the cheapest path without cycles. Minimal Spanning Trees will be your query
optimizer.

## 3. Deliverables & Version Control
By the final deadline, you must submit their work following these strict version control
and packaging guidelines:
A. GitHub Repository (Mandatory): Your codebase must be maintained in a public
GitHub repository.
o We expect to see a continuous history of commits. A repository with a single
massive commit at the end will not be acceptable.
o Use a proper ‘.gitignore’ file (do not push compiled .exe files or the raw TPC-H
datasets to GitHub).
B. Project Archive: A .zip file uploaded to the GCR containing:
o The complete C++ Source Code (cleanly separated into .h and .cpp files).
o A  Build  Script  (Makefile  or  CMakeLists.txt)  to  compile  your  engine  via  the
command line.
o The  Automated  Test  Runner:  A  specific  executable  script  or  file  (e.g.,
test_runner.cpp or run_tests.sh) that automatically processes your queries.txt
## Workload File.
o A README.md containing a link to your GitHub repo and explicit instructions on
how to compile and execute the Test Runner.
C. The Research Report (PDF): A formal 5-8 page technical paper documenting:
o Mathematical  time/space  complexity  proofs  for  your  custom  data  structures
(Buffer Pool, Indexer, Parser).
o Empirical benchmarking graphs (Execution time vs. Data Size).
o Memory profiling analysis (LRU cache page-fault rates).



## 4. Live Demo & Evaluation Protocol
Evaluation will be conducted via a strict 15-minute live demonstration. The evaluation
will heavily rely on your system's ability to log its internal decision-making processes.
## The Automated Run & Log Evaluation:
At the start of the demo, the evaluator will instruct you to execute your Test Runner file.
Your engine must process your ‘queries.txt’ Workload File and output a highly detailed
‘nanodb_execution.log’ file. The evaluator will review this log in real-time to verify:
- Cache eviction events (e.g., [LOG] Page 42 evicted via LRU, written to disk).
- Query parsing steps (e.g., [LOG] Infix "c_acctbal > 5000" converted to Postfix
## "c_acctbal 5000 >").
- Optimizer  decisions  (e.g., [LOG]  Multi-table  join  routed  via  MST:  customer ->
orders -> lineitem).
## Specific Demo Execution Steps:
Alongside the log review, you will execute the following live test cases using the TPC-H
schema:
- Test Case A (The Parser & Evaluator): Input a complex string: SELECT WHERE
(c_acctbal > 5000 AND c_mktsegment == "BUILDING") OR c_nationkey == 15. Your
engine must print the generated Postfix expression from your custom Stack and
output the correct filtered rows.
- Test Case B (The Index Optimizer): Execute a search for a specific c_custkey on
your 100,000 records. First, force the engine to use a sequential Array scan and
print the execution time. Second, run the exact same query using your custom
Balanced Binary Tree index. The time reduction must be visibly printed to the
console.
- Test Case C (The Join Optimizer): Execute a 3-table join (customer JOIN orders
JOIN lineitem). Print the generated Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) path your graph-
based optimizer chose before outputting the joined data.
- Test Case D (The Memory Stress Test): We will artificially restrict your Buffer Pool
array to only 50 memory pages. You will then run a query that requires scanning
5,000 lineitem records. Your engine must print the total number of times the
Doubly Linked List LRU cache had to evict an old page to disk.
- Test Case E (Priority Queue Concurrency): We will simulate a flooded system by
submitting 50 standard SELECT queries into your queue, immediately followed by

an admin-level UPDATE transaction to a customer's balance. Your Priority Queue
must  intercept  and  execute  the  admin  transaction  before  finishing  the
background reads.
- Test Case F (Deep Expression Tree Edge Case): We will input a deeply nested
and  mathematically  complex  query:  SELECT  WHERE  (  (o_totalprice  *  1.5)  >
100000 AND (o_custkey % 2 == 0) ) OR (o_orderstatus != "O"). Your system must
correctly evaluate the operator precedence and mathematical mutations using
your Tree/Stack parsers without crashing.
- Test Case G (Durability & Persistence): You will insert 5 new records into the
customer table. You will then completely terminate the NanoDB program. Upon
rebooting the engine, you must successfully query those 5 new records, proving
your File Operations successfully serialized the custom memory pages to disk
before shutdown.
## The Viva Defense:
Following the demo, the evaluator will randomly select blocks of your data structure
implementations. You must explain the pointer arithmetic and algorithmic logic on the
spot.

## 5. Grading & Penalty Box
- The Standard Template Library (STL) Ban: The use of ANY C++ STL container
(std::vector, std::list, std::map, std::stack, std::queue, std::set, etc.) or algorithm
(std::sort, std::find) will result in an immediate -100% deduction for that specific
architectural section. You must build the tools you use.
- Memory Leaks: Failure to properly delete dynamically allocated memory (verified
via tools like Valgrind) will result in a flat -15 point deduction from the final grade.
- Plagiarism & Academic Integrity: Inability to explain your own codebase during
the Viva, missing execution logs, or discrepancies in your GitHub commit history
(e.g.,  massive  copy-pasted  single  commits)  will  be  treated  as  an  academic
integrity  violation,  resulting  in  an  F  grade  for  the  project  and  course  as  per
university policy.



## Research & Benchmarking Deliverables
Do  not  just  submit  code.  You  must  prove  your  engine  works  mathematically  and
empirically.
- Complexity Analysis: Document the theoretical time and space complexity for
your specific implementations of the Buffer Pool, Indexer, and Query Parser.
- Empirical Benchmarking: Plot execution times for 1K, 10K, and 100K record
insertions and retrievals. Compare your Balanced Tree Index vs. an unindexed
sequential scan.
- Memory Profiling: Force a bottleneck. Allocate only 50 memory pages for 10,000
records. Graph your LRU cache's page-fault rate.

## Critical Deductions & Penalty Box
- The Standard Template Library (STL) Ban: The use of ANY C++ STL container
(std::vector, std::list, std::map, std::stack, std::queue, std::set, etc.) or algorithm
(std::sort, std::find) will result in an immediate -100% deduction for that specific
rubric section. You must build the tools you use.
- Memory Leaks: Failure to properly delete dynamically allocated memory (verified
via tools like Valgrind) will result in a flat -15 point deduction from the final grade.
- Plagiarism & Academic Integrity: Plagiarism in the project will result in an F grade
in the course. This includes copying code from peers, the internet, or passing off
heavily generated LLM code as your own without deep understanding. You will be
asked to defend your architectural decisions in a viva voce.
